# Community

`Frontend Fundamentals` (FF) is developing standards for good code together with the community.

It's currently maintained by the Toss Frontend chapter.

## Featured Discussions

Explore some of the best discussions in the community. Expand your thinking about good code beyond what's in the Frontend Fundamentals documentation.

## Discussing Code Concerns

If you have code that you're concerned about, post it on the GitHub discussions.
You can receive reviews from the community from various perspectives on your code and discuss the standards for good code with the community.

Cases that receive a lot of support can be directly added to the Frontend Fundamentals documentation. The contribution method will be announced later.

## Adding Opinions on Good Code Standards

If you have opinions on the standards for good code or want to add new opinions, vote on what makes better code and leave your thoughts.
Communicate with the community to create richer and deeper standards.

This can be an opportunity to establish your own criteria on whether this code is good or that code is good.
