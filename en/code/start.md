# Getting Started

`Frontend Fundamentals` (FF) provides standards for good frontend code.
Use it as a compass to find direction when you want to improve code quality as a frontend developer.

It presents [four principles](./index.md) of good code, along with specific examples and solutions.

## When to Use

- 🦨 Developers who are concerned about code but find it **difficult to explain logically**
- 👀 Developers who want to learn how to **quickly detect and improve bad code**
- 🤓 Developers who, during code reviews, follow a link provided by someone and come to **objectively recognize** "Oh, this is how my code was"
- 👥 Developers who want to establish a common coding style and code quality standards **with their team**
