# Naming Magic Numbers

<div style="margin-top: 16px">
<Badge type="info" text="Readability" />
</div>

**Magic Number** refers to directly inserting numerical values into the source code without explicitly stating their meaning.

For example, using the value `404` directly as the HTTP status code for Not Found, or using `86400` seconds directly to represent a day.

## üìù Code Example

The following code is a function that retrieves the new like count when the like button is clicked.

```typescript 3
async function onLikeClick() {
  await postLike(url);
  await delay(300);
  await refetchPostLike();
}
```

## üëÉ Smell the Code

### Readability

The value `300` passed to the `delay` function is used in an unclear context.
If you are not the original developer of the code, you may not know why it waits for 300ms.

- Is it waiting for the animation to complete?
- Is it waiting for the like to be reflected?
- Was it a test code that was forgotten to be removed?

When multiple developers work on the same code, the intention may not be accurately understood, leading to unintended modifications.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Work on Improving

To accurately represent the context of the number `300`, you can declare it as a constant `ANIMATION_DELAY_MS`.

```typescript 1,5
const ANIMATION_DELAY_MS = 300;

async function onLikeClick() {
  await postLike(url);
  await delay(ANIMATION_DELAY_MS);
  await refetchPostLike();
}
```
