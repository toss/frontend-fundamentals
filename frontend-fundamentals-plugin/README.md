# Frontend Fundamentals Plugin

> Claude Code plugin for automated code quality review

**Frontend Fundamentals Plugin** brings [Frontend Fundamentals](https://frontend-fundamentals.com) code quality principles directly into your Claude Code workflow. It automatically reviews your code against 4 core principles and suggests improvements.

## 🧭 When to Use

- 🔍 When you've finished coding and want a quick quality check
- 🔄 When you want Claude to iteratively improve code until it meets standards
- 👥 When you're reviewing a PR and want consistent quality criteria
- 🛠️ When your team wants to enforce shared code quality standards

## 📦 Installation

### From GitHub (Recommended)

**Step 1:** Add the marketplace
```bash
/plugin marketplace add toss/frontend-fundamentals
```

**Step 2:** Install the plugin
```bash
/plugin install frontend-fundamentals@toss-frontend-fundamentals
```

Or use the interactive UI: run `/plugin`, go to **Discover** tab, and select the plugin.

### From Local Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/toss/frontend-fundamentals.git
claude --plugin ./frontend-fundamentals/frontend-fundamentals-plugin
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Review After Coding

```
/frontend-fundamentals:review
```

Reviews your branch diff against `main` and outputs findings as Critical / Warnings / Suggestions.

### Iterative Improvement (Recommended)

Ask Claude to keep improving until the review passes:

```
Review my code with /frontend-fundamentals:review and fix any issues found.
Repeat until no critical issues remain.
```

This creates a feedback loop: review → fix → re-review → repeat until clean.

### Review Specific Files

```
/frontend-fundamentals:review src/components/UserForm.tsx
```

## 📚 Code Quality Principles

| Principle | What It Checks |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Cohesion** | Are related things together? (scattered files, magic numbers) |
| **Coupling** | Is change impact minimized? (props drilling, god hooks) |
| **Predictability** | Does code do what the name says? (hidden side effects) |
| **Readability** | Is code easy to follow? (nested ternaries, complex conditions) |

## 📝 Example Output

```markdown
# Code Review: feature/user-form

## Summary
Props drilling through 3 layers and inconsistent validation return types.

## Critical (must fix)
- **Coupling** `UserForm.tsx:L42` - Props pass through 3 layers unused
  → Use composition pattern with children

## Warnings (should fix)
- **Predictability** `validators.ts:L15` - Inconsistent return types
  → Use ValidationResult type for all validators
```

## 🧪 For Contributors: Evaluation System

The `/eval` directory contains test tasks and grading criteria to verify skills work correctly.

### When to Run Evaluations

- 📝 After modifying any skill file
- 🆕 When adding new code patterns to detect
- 🐛 When fixing false positives/negatives in reviews

### Structure

```
eval/
├── tasks/           # Test code with seeded issues
│   ├── cohesion/
│   ├── coupling/
│   ├── predictability/
│   └── readability/
├── graders/         # Grading criteria (PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL)
│   └── grader.md
├── results/         # Evaluation results by date
└── run-eval.md      # How to run evaluations
```

### Quick Start

1. Run baseline (without skill) to establish comparison
2. Run with skill loaded
3. Grade using `eval/graders/grader.md` criteria
4. Skill passes if ≥2/3 trials achieve PASS

See `eval/run-eval.md` for detailed instructions.
