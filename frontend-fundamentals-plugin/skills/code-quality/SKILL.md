# Frontend Code Quality Principles

Apply these four principles when writing frontend code:

1. **Readability** - Code should be easy to read and understand
2. **Predictability** - Functions should behave as their names suggest
3. **Cohesion** - Code that changes together should live together
4. **Coupling** - Minimize scope of impact when code changes
